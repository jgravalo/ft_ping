# ft_ping

Replica of the `ping` command in C using raw sockets, with IPv4 support, round-trip time statistics, and ICMP error display in verbose mode. This project is based on the behavior and output of `ping` from `inetutils-2.0`.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Sends ICMP Echo Request packets and waits for Echo Reply.
- Calculates and displays:
  - Round-trip time (RTT)
  - Packet loss percentage
  - Min/avg/max/mdev
- Implements raw socket usage (`SOCK_RAW`) with manual packet construction.
- Handles interrupt signal (`Ctrl+C`) to print final statistics.
- Uses `select()` for timeout management and responsiveness.
- Implements ICMP checksum manually.
